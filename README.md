My academic journey and professional engagements have equipped me with robust analytical skills and a deep understanding of data-driven decision-making processes. I currently serve as a Graduate Research assistant at the university, where I am deeply involved in groundbreaking research in the healthcare domain, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) applications. This role allows me to explore innovative ways to leverage machine learning to improve data interpretability and healthcare outcomes.

My unique selling proposition lies in my diverse range of interests and hobbies, which enhance my ability to understand varied perspectives and foster effective collaboration. This versatility enables me to navigate and connect different fields, from technology to business management, driving innovative solutions and strategic decision-making.

At Wipro Limited in India, as a Software Quality Analyst, I led enhancements in software functionality and operational efficiency. My initiatives streamlined workflows, cut down process bottlenecks, and expedited project delivery by 23%, ensuring high user satisfaction and robust software quality.

As part of my MIS curriculum, I led a consulting project for GreenPath Financial Wellness, where I applied my analytical and project management skills to assess and address financial wellness barriers in under-served communities, providing strategic insights and actionable solutions to enhance service delivery and client engagement.

I am actively seeking roles as a Business Analyst, Data Analyst, or Data Scientist, where I can leverage my analytical acumen and methodical problem-solving to maximize data utility, drive strategic decisions, and propel business growth.
